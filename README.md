# tempCtrl
Home temperature control with touch screen, and remote sensors

Nextion 2.4" (NX3224T024_11) is the target touchscreen. ITEADLIB Arduino Nextion library can be found here: https://github.com/itead/ITEADLIB_Arduino_Nextion. Also there is a local copy on tempCtrl repository with minimum changes to make it work for Arduino-like MEGA2560 board (SainSmart).
